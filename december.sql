As long as flu activity is ongoing, it''s not too late to get vaccinated, even in January or later.  - - With flu activity increasing and family and friends planning gatherings for the holidays, now is a great time to get a flu vaccine if you haven''t been vaccinated yet this season. A flu vaccine can protect you and your loved ones from the flu.   Getting the flu vaccine is simple, and it''s the most important thing you can do to protect yourself and your family from the flu.

As long as flu activity is ongoing, it''s not too late to get vaccinated, even in January or later.  - - With flu activity increasing and family and friends planning gatherings for the holidays, now is a great time to get a flu vaccine if you haven''t been vaccinated yet this season. A flu vaccine can protect you and your loved ones from the flu.   Getting the flu vaccine is simple, and it''s the most important thing you can do to protect yourself and your family from the flu.
